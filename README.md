## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis pipeline for banking data, including:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis with advanced visualizations
- Customer segmentation using RFM analysis and K-means clustering
- Anomaly detection for identifying suspicious transactions
- Feature engineering for enhanced customer insights

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling
- **Advanced Visualization**: Interactive charts using Plotly and Seaborn for insightful data exploration
- **Customer Segmentation**: RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-means clustering
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for better visualization
- **Anomaly Detection**: Isolation Forest algorithm for fraud detection in transactions
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features from transaction data

## 📋 Contents
